The libmrh library is used to develop applications for the MRH platform.
It contains method for managing events, handling platform data and files 
and defines the default functions used by MRH applications.

This documentation includes listings for the internal functions, enumerations, 
etc. used by the library itself. These are not meant to be used directly for 
service development but as information for library development.

As such, this documentation is both aimed at developers wanting to write their 
own user application service as well as library developers wishing to improve 
on the libmrh source.
