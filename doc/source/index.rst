libmrh is an open source library which is intended to be used for application 
development. It includes functions for all default events and file structures.

This documentation includes listings for the internal functions, enumerations, 
etc. used by the library itself. These are not meant to be used directly for 
service development but as information for library development.

As such, this documentation is both aimed at developers wanting to write their 
own user application service as well as library developers wishing to improve 
on the libmrh source.
